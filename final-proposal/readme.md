# Final Project Proposal.

### Project Idea
For my final project I have chosen to try to code a sketch that is a music visualizier, that will either starts with a circle and changes with the music or have shapes glow bigher when certain parts of the song are played. Though if I can't manage to crete this I will code a game that had simple movements like jump over things.

### Inspiration
I found inspiration for doing to a music visualizier from looking at the past final projects, and googling coding examples p5.js projects. I choose to do one for my project because I though they looked super intersting and who doesn't love to involove music in projects that you are creating.

### Problems
For this project that I am creating the first this that I need to understand to do it is how to inport a song into the code for the music visualizier. After that it is just adapting the code to work with the song and get everything to work right.

### Work Plans
- The first thing to accomplish is to come up with an idea for my final project by Nov. 24
- Second, finish the proposal by Nov. 28
- Third, finish most of the sketch by Dec. 4
- Do the finishing touches on the sketch, making sure everything is working correctly and it makes sense by Dec. 9
- Submit before deadline on Dec. 10 at 8am.

To ensure that I will finish the final project on time, I will meet the self made deadlines that I gave me. This will help make sure that on the 10 of december I will have completed the project in full and made it.

### Work for Project.
Up to this point in the project, I have not completed a lot in terms of what needs to be done. I have come up with a an idea, and started the base of the coding for the music visualizier.
