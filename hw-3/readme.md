["Hello World"](https://emileek.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

### Summarize and Steps Taken.
Throughout this week I watched the videos that were posted, while working the assignments as the video described. To make sure I understand every function that we are going to use throughout the semester, I messed around and tried different colors for backgroud and different locations for the canvas.
The steps I took this week was to take this weeks assignments, contents and spend it out over the week and practice coding the functions that we are learning this week. That way I know what I am doing in the future weeks assignments. Finally updated my github page with the new hw-3 assigments.

### Problems & Helping Classmates
The only problem that I ran into this week was that I could not manage to get my computer to let me open up the index.html file in the browser directly from Atom. I did not post this issue to  the forum, I instead would open the index.html file from finder and drop it on the safari icon to open it.
I did look at the Issue Forums page this week and students were posting on it, but I did not help anyone with a problem that they had, because I did not know how to fix it. I saw a post about a command line question and wanted to be of help but did not have a clue on how to help.
### Learning Further
 With the Hello World Sketch we had the text "Hello World" I would like to know if it is possible to make the text bigger? Would use the # to make text bigger like a header or is it completely different?
