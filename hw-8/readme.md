### Summary of the week.
This week for the homework assigment I started the code like always with the
function setup() and defined the canvas size. Then declared the function draw()
and within the function I declared the background color to white. I also assigned
variable numbers for the fill of the ellipse so that the color would be choosen at
random.

### Learning further.
In the future of the course, I will like to learn more about what loops are
capable of creating within the code, and how it can be manipulated into something creative
