#### Emilee Kenneally, Section 50
## Final Project sketch.

#### What I did.
For my sketch, I choose to code a simple music Visualizer. The reasoning on why I choose to accomplish this is becasue I thought the examples on the course website looked interest, so I though I would try it.

#### Successes that I had will creating the code.
The success that I had while creating the code was accomplished throughtout many attempts and sketch breaks.
- Finally, being able to upload a song to the code, this was one that needed to happen if I wanted to accomplish the visualizer.
- So once I got my sketch working with music it was on the the next task which was designing the code for the visualizer to work. I do have to say I am not a great coder so this was a bit challenging will the level of coding I do have.
- One of the successes that I had accomplished was, getting the visualizer to work with the frequency on the music I had.
  - From defining varibles, to undersating the p5.FFT and the parameters that were included, and defining the angle mode to use degrees rather then radians to make it easier on my brain, then defining varibles using the angles to draw the ellipses that I coded.


#### Failures that accoured throughout.
- The one major failure that I had while working on this sketch was not starting with the local server.
  - In the begining I forgot that startServer was a package that would help in coding for this project.
  - When I did have server opened, the music for my sketch was not working or loading. The only thing that would be on the sketch was the work loading forever, it didn't want to load. I took me a while to understand why I could hear anything, I went back and look at the course webpage to find tips on what might be happpening.
  - So finally, I found startServer and when applied to Atom, I finally got the music playing instantly without the loading appearing on the sketch and so I could start on the next part.
- The second challenge that I had faced was getting an image in to browser. I had created a variable img , then preloaded in the code and finally set it as my background. I thought this would work but sadly no. So to fix this I tried to reread the course pages on images from week 13 possibly, but didn't not have any luck on fixing the problem that was accouring. I had messed with image that  I wanted  in the sketch on/off for about a week before I was about to give up on it. Finally with a thread of luck I figured out the problem, and a simple mis-code is all it was. I had set a background color to black and the image was behind it.
- The other failures and attempts that I had, were just coding errors that would continuously break my sketch sadly. I wanted to add a moving circle visualizer that would go of the volume of my sketch rather then the frequency. But after numerous attempts and breaks I gave up on that idea. I could not figure out how to use both frequency visualizers and Amplitude visualizrs in one sketch. That was disappointing, I really hoped it was eventally work.
- I also was trying to rotate the visualizer as a whole as the music was playing but only managed to get it to rotate it a little bit and not continuously, as of now I am still trying this out, but with no luck.


#### Where I got help throughtout the process of the project.
- I looked on the course webpage when I need help with the image in the sketch and loading sound in the code as well
  - The webpage did help in the sound, upon realizing that using the package startServer, would allow me to play the song without waiting a crazy amount of time to load. That definately help move the processes along.
  - As for the image, I had a simple coding error as to why it did not work, the page gave a go look at how to do it and if I was doing it right.
- Google and Youtube
  - I did have to google samples of visualizers to see what they looked like and ideas to help. Same goes for youtube videos. Both gave good representations of what my sketch should look like when completed.
- The p5 Reference page.
  - The page help in terms of understanding what functions to use and what the parameters I need. It also gave a example to help me. For instance using the p5.FFT function, I did not know what the parameter smoothing was until I had messed with it on the p5 reference page. It was helpful to understand more about the functions I needed and used.
