### Steps taken this week.
Throughout this week, I have tried a few different ways to create my sketch.
  1. The first step that I had took was simply editing the index.html to include my class
     sqaures.js so that I could include it in the sketch.js
  2. I wrote my code, including my class within the fuction draw().
  3. I did run into some problems while writing my code that include:
      - I had a little bit of trouble initally getting my class file work in my sketch.js. I fixed this problem by looking through the examples in the course work and realizing I made a couple of simple mistakes.
      - I also had a problem with my sketch showing up in the broswer file, to fix this error I wrote on the issue forum. I did not recieve any feedback from classmates. I did realize my mistake later that day.
      - I also rewatched the youtube videos to try and help me understand the mistakes I had made and to help correct the errors that I had made.
