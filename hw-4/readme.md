### Summary and steps taken this week.
1. I did this week is read and take detailed notes about the different types of functions that we are using through the week and semester.
2. I reviewed the notes and the P5 describtion pages before starting the homework.
3. The steps that I had taken this week involving the homework were.
    - Setting up the sketch.
    - Understanding how different functions work within the sketch and what function works best for what was needed.
    - Finally, putting the portrait together.


  ### Problems/Issues.s
I did not have a ton of problems come up this week during the homework. One that I ran into was figuring out where shapes werer going to be placed. After a while I got used to which parameters were going to move and where the end up.  Other problems that I ran into this week were forgeting commas in certian line of codes and capitalizing certian letter in the code, like strokeWeight. To fix these I errors I looked at the video that was posted and got advice in were to look and how to spot errors.



### Learing Further.
After this weeks homwork and lesson I would like to explore the functions translate, rotate more and how it can change the center of the grid.
