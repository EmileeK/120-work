### Summarize and steps taken:
This week learning about how to make our sketch move was really neat.
  - The first step that I took this week was reading the book and website
  - Before starting to write my code I made a simple drawing of what I was going to try to make.
  - Finally, I wrote the code and created my monkey.
  - The last step I made was trying to make an simple shape move across the screen.

### Problems during the week:
During this week I had a couple problems when creating my sketch. The major problem that occurred for me was being able to animate the ellispe in the sketch without the help of the mouse. To solve this problem that I had, I first googled it and then watched a video on youtube.

### Learning Further:
I loved that we have just started to learn about how to animate our sketches. I would to explore this further and to understand how a single line of code can change your sketch a lot.
