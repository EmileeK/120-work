# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing
- Line 3 is seting up the object ball, then lines 4-10 are creating different varibles and assigning a value to the variables with the object ball.
- Lines 12-15, is creating the function by using the fuction setup(), and within the function you create the canvas size of windowWidth and 400 px tall, and a background color of white.
- Lines 19-39 is begining the sketch by calling the funtion draw(). Within the function we draw the ellipse and the if statements that being used.
- Lines 21-22, the varibles ball.x and ball.y are getting a new value that will be used in the coming lines.
- Lines 25-27, is the first conditonal statment that makes the ellipse move throughtout the sketch. It is saying that if the ball.x is greater than the width or less than 0 then the ball will continue to turn back around when it hits width or 0 at the speed of 1 until it the width and -1 until the ball reaches 0.
- Lines 28-30, This conditional statement is dealing with the height of the ball.y by creating a statement that if the ball is greater than the hieght the ball will turn around at the speed of 1 and then if the ball is less than 0 the ball will turn aorund at the speed of -1.
- Lines 32-33 create the ellispe, line 32 creates the fill color of the ellispe which is white. Line 33 draws the ellispe at the varibles that were defined at in lines 4-10.
- Lines 36-39, uses the fuction mousePressed(), that allows the ball to change its course of its path just by clicking the mouse.



## How did you alter the sketch?
To alter the sketch I:
- Created a if statement that allowed the ball the change between three colors depending on where it was located on the screen according the varible ball.x and width of the sketch.
