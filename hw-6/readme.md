### Summary of the week.
The lessons that we learned were super cool how a simple math equation can help develop your sketch further.
This week the steps that I took to create my code and sketch were:
  - Reading the p5 reference pages of the functions that I choose to use. This way I had a clear idea how and why I chose it.
  - I also played with the code until I made what I was hoping to accomplish.
  - Lastly, I continued to use different functions to see what could happen in my code.



### Problems through out the week
I did run into a few problems while working this week, but nothing to big.
  1. The first problem, that I ran into was just with the simple math equations and making sure they ran correctly and not break the code. To fix the errors that occured I messed with different numbers.
  2. Second, when doing the random function for color, I found it hard to get a range of color beyond blues and greens.


### Learning further.
Finally, to finish off the week and going into next I would love to learn what other things can be created when the random function is used.
