### Steps taken this week.
For the homework this week I:
  1. I created a monkey array, and defined to functions that used the monkey.
  2. On the course page I really liked the homework example with the smiley faces and decided to try something similar and get all the objects going in one direction which ended up having the monkey heads travel to the upper left of the corner.
  3. As, the monkeys get to the upper left corner of the screen the monkeys will get smaller and smaller.
  4. When it can time to define the monkeyCartoon(), I decided instead of create a new object to be draw within the code, I used my monkey from week 5's homework and deleted the body so there would any be the head moving around the screen.

### Learn Futher.
In the weeks lesson we learn about functions and how we can define our own for what we need within our lines of code. Is there any limit to what can or can not be placed in a function or be defined as a function?
